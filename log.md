# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Set up [github] (https://github.com/boudiccaeceni) on a new machine, set up ssh key and forked this repo. 

**Thoughts:** My coding background is - I studied Computing and IT with the Open University from 2011 to 2015. We did a little visual basic which was fun but I didn't get the impression it was that relevant. I dropped out when ill health coincided with the module on agile - I just wanted to code at that point. Fast forward a few years and after some intense thinking about what I want to retrain in as my health improves I realised it was coding :)
I'm currently enrolled on the Break into Tech course with Skillcrush and stalled at the point of building a portfolio site as I don't think I'm ready to publicise my skills. Also I have been working through free code camp and have just started the Applied Visual Design chapter. ALSO I have nearly finished Getting Started with Python presented by Charles Severance at the University of Michigan, via coursera. Clearly I lack focus, but have a lot of enthusiasm!

**Link to work:** Not much to see yet but here's my github https://github.com/boudiccaeceni

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
