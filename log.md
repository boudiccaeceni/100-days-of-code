# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Set up [github](https://github.com/boudiccaeceni) on a new machine, set up ssh key and forked this repo. 

**Thoughts:** My coding background is - I studied Computing and IT with the Open University from 2011 to 2015. We did a little visual basic which was fun but I didn't get the impression it was that relevant. I dropped out when ill health coincided with the module on agile - I just wanted to code at that point. Fast forward a few years and after some intense thinking about what I want to retrain in as my health improves I realised it was coding :)
I'm currently enrolled on the [Break into Tech course with Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/break-into-tech-blueprint) and stalled at the point of building a portfolio site as I don't think I'm ready to publicise my skills. Also I have been working through free code camp and have just started the Applied Visual Design chapter. ALSO I have nearly finished [Getting Started with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome) presented by Charles Severance at the University of Michigan, via coursera. Clearly I lack focus, but have a lot of enthusiasm!
Yesterday I jumped ahead in my skillcrush course to set up a wordpress blog to document my coding journey. When it's live I will put a link here.
At 44 it's easy to feel that I'm too old to start something new - however, life is short and I'm not about to give up! I get real satisfaction from understanding and using technical ideas - hence my enjoyment of knitting lace! Plus I think that coding is a skill that once I have I can shoose who I work for so my earning sources will align with my values.

### Day 2: November 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercise 4.06 in the coursera course. This is about building and using functions. 

**Thoughts**: I was confused over the return value used inside the function and how to call and print the function.  I was missing a step and now understand that the return value inside the function is not used anywhere else, that it's job is just to put the result of a calculation into the function. (At this stage and in this case anyway!) I rewatched the lecture videos and made notes and diagrams and wrote my ocde parallel to an example piece of code - this is how I worked out that a step was missing. I feel like I learned more than if I'd asked for guidance. Two useful affirmations that I'm trying to build into my routine are,"Mistakes are a stepping stone to success. They are the path I must tread to achieve my dreams" and, "When I fail, I learn. My failures are temporary because my perseverence is permanent. I push forward at all times because I know I can succeed. As I continually believe in myself, my confidence increases." I'm sure these helped me persevere today so I'm sharing them incase they help others!

### Day 3: November 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through chapters on finding the largest (and smallest) value, and Loop idioms. Introduced to Boolean variables and the None variable. Happy to have noted that using -1 or 1000 for finding the largest and smallest numbers respectively is not ideal and will quickly go wrong - before the materials pointed it out :D Also had counselling call with skillcrush mentor which was super useful and gave me a focus. 

**Thoughts**: The happy thing above is really encouraging to me and I'll have to try and remember moments like this when I get super frustrated and de motivated in future when it gets more difficult!


### Day 4: November 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sweating and dizzy with 'flu :o Attempted a worked example where you enter numbers and when you input Done, the program prints the total, count and average of the number. Also using try/except for anything which isn't Done or a number and printing a useful error message before asking for another input. Seemed easy to do! Attempting last assignment which is similar but which asks us to print largest and smallest. Too ill to concentrate much so after 2 hours I am retiring to the sofa :( 

**Thoughts**: Pleased I grasped a worked example and went ahead and solved it before watching all of the video. And pleased I managed to put some time in despite being ill :o


### Day !=5: November 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Mostly sneezing and dizzy today. I had a read through some of the discussion forum posts about the assignment and thought about it a lot but brain power was in short supply so I didn't get much done. Not sure I spent an hour at the desk so not counting today. 

**Thoughts**: I was super motivated to work on the assignment despite being ill and unable to which is good news!


### Day 5: November 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last assignment on the course! We'd made short programs that asked for user input and gave a total and count, and we'd made ones which worked from a list of numbers written into the code and printed out the smallest. In the assignment we had to write one which asked for user input - carried out error checking - and printed out the smallest and largest after the user was done. So I was working out how to take the smallest calculation from one and combine it with the user input of the other. 

**Thoughts**: So pleased that I got it to work without asking for advice on the forums :D

### Day 6: November 30, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the "milestone project" in my skillcrush course. This is a portfolio site with image of the things we've built in the course so far. I set up a git repo for this. 

**Thoughts**: Just about well enough to get back to this after monster cold :o 
I have been putting this off because I don't feel that I (or anyone) can be at a level where it's appropriate to have a portfolio site at this stage of the course. I realise that no-one will even see it ofcourse, but I find it very difficult to write a blurb like "My name is x and I'm passionate about coding bla bla bla" when I can just about code up a website with loads of instructions and guidance over a period of days. It seems very premature to be advertising my skills. I would prefer to be making a website about something I'm interested in instead, then I wouldn't feel so self conscious. Maybe I will just do that and see what they say - it's just different words after all, there'll be similar elements. Hmm.

### Day 7: December 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the milestone project. Taking the opportunity to become more familiar with git and github, so I created a branch and then merged it once I'd finished for the day. I drew a diagram of what my sections' classes and ids will be called.  

**Thoughts**: The github processes are not entirely clear to me at the moment so I reckon practice is key. Naming and structure of sections is quite confusing too so I asked on the class slack channel if there are guildelines anywhere.

### Day 8: February 20, 2020 

**Today's Intentions**: 
<ul>
  <li><s>restart 100 days of code</s></li>
  <li><s>identify relevant repos for current study</s></li>
  <li>ensure files on laptop are up to date</li>
  <li>if time left, start working on milestone project</li>
</ul>

**Thoughts**: Massive break due to illness and ongoing computer problems. Cannot find a keyboard that actually works, have tried 4 so far. Feel overwhelmed with trying to get back on track with the [skillcrush](https://www.skillcrush.com) modules. Plan is to work on the milestone project and at the same time work through the git/github module again and regularly use github to keep everything up to date. Using [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/home) to try and stay on track.


### Day 9: February 21, 2020 

**Today's Intentions**: 
<ul>
  <li>work through the skillcrush module on git and github until I get to the point where I can do the next step</li>
  <li>ensure files on laptop are up to date</li>
  <li>if time left, start working on milestone project</li>
</ul>

**Yesterday's Progress**: STARTED. Working with command line/gitbash and that started to feel familiar again. Attended a meetup group which was excellent although way out of my comfort zone.   

**Thoughts**: I have made lists before but I think it might be helpful if I made a big colourful chart I can put up on a wall to see the modules I'm going to be working through and hopeful estimates of timeframes. ALSO, when committing changes to this log should I be hitting the commit to master branch button or creating a new branch. I've been doing the former as it was the default. Suspect it should be the latter but will wait until I understand it better as don't want to muck everything up/lose the log etc.

### Day 10: February 22, 2020 

**Today's Intentions**: 
<ul>
  <li><s>work through the skillcrush module on git and github until I get to the point where I can do the next step (didn't quite manage that yesterday)</s></li>
  <li>ensure files on laptop are up to date</li>
  <li>go to hackathon</li>
</ul>

**Yesterday's Progress**:Finished another github module. Put all courses onto trello. I find ticking things off really motivates me and I'm going to make this into a gantt chart. Being able to show that I project managed my own home studies has got to look good in a job interview right?   

**Thoughts**: It's good to do this first thing in the day incase I don't have time later. I'm pretty excited about seeing the above mentioned gantt chart and thinking about being able to work on projects on github.

### Day 11: February 23, 2020 

**Today's Intentions**: 
<ul>
  <li><s>work through another lesson of the github module</s></li>
  <li>work out if I have done this log file correctly - pretty sure I should have separated it from the original more thoroughly</li>
  <li><s>put all modules into trello and gantt chart</s></li>
  <li>start working on portfolio</li>
</ul>

**Thoughts**: There is really some kind of block in my mind about continuing with the portfolio site. I think it will be useful to continue with the github module and finish that first, then concentrate on the site.

### Day 12: February 24, 2020

**Today's Intentions**: Not much time so just to work through more of the git module. Not enough time to get into the site building.

**Thoughts**: Wednesday and Thursday I will dedicate to the site - to try and get it done very early in March. Before 5th.


### Day 13: February 25, 2020 

**Today's Intentions**: Another super busy day so not much time to study but started the code institute 5 day coding challenge.

**Thoughts**: Need to ringfence some time to do this as other stuff keeps creeping into the day.

### Day 14: February 26, 2020 

**Today's Intentions**: Work on Code Institute 5 day coding challenge.  

**Thoughts**: Very little time but did days 1 and 2 of this.


### Day 15: February 27, 2020 

**Today's Intentions**: 
<ul>
  <li>Keep up to date on the 5DCC</li>
  <li>Tick another github lesson off the trello list</li>
</ul>

**Thoughts**: Finished another github module, dealing with merge conflicts this time. Got up to date on the 5DCC. It's complete beginner web stuff so I'm being reminded that I do actually know some stuff. I really need this kind of reinforcement at this point.

### Day 16: February 28, 20209 

**Today's Progress**: The certificate from the 5 day coding challenge from [Code Institute 5DCC] (https://courses.codeinstitute.net/certificates/85d9ca79adec44a2a0a37b15502aea88). The end of the course touched on a bit of responsive functionality which was exciting and remotivated me to get onto this section of my proper course! There was also a little bit of JavaScript which was familiar from studying visual basic as part of an (unfinished) degree in Computing and IT the open univeristy (apparently to teach you basically how OOP works - which it did as I recognised JavaScript - but no actual use to anyone in real life...) So I'm excited about getting to learn that in more depth too.
Worked through a lesson of the github module - this was about changing commit messages, deleting commits both on local machines and remote repos. 

**Thoughts:** Focussing on my March 20th deadline to get the basic portfolio page done. Really want to get past it.
